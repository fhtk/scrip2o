This tool converts PokéScrip text files into their binary equivalents.
PokéScrip is a low-level format designed to have a 1:1 semantic correlation
with the scripting bytecode used in the third generation core series Pokémon
games for the Nintendo® Game Boy Advance™. It can serve either as a concise,
close-to-the-metal way to write scripts for these game engines, or as a target
for higher-level languages, including PretScript and PKS2. The format is on
the same level as the PokéSnip text encoding format. Run ‘scrip2o --help’ for
details.
